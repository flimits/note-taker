# note-taker
This is an application that can be used to write and save notes.


## Psuedo Code

The below was a psuedo coding exercise I did with others in order to come up with an attack plan of our to build the final touches on the Note-Taker application. 

### From the course story of what is required

* GIVEN a note-taking application
* WHEN I open the Note Taker
* THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column
* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note's text
* THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
* WHEN I click on the Save button
* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
* THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
* WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
* THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column and the button disappears

### Psuedo code part

* import express module to our server
* import require("./db/db.json")
* create app variable pointing to new express object(express())
* app.use(*middleware*){ -json, urlencoded, staticify(public)}
* 
* get/delete/post requests:
* 
* get request to send index.html, route: '/'
* get request to send notes.html, route: '/notes'
* 
* get request to fetch our api to send notes from db.json, route: '/api/notes'
* post request to fetch our api to modify with parsed req.body data and push post to db.json with fs.writeFile, route: '/api/notes', return res.json;
* delete request to delete specific note, *EXTRA CRED* remove specific data from db.json and push with fs.writeFile,  route: '/api/notes/:notes_id', return res.json;
* app.listen
